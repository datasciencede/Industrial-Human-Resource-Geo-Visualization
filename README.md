# Industrial-Human-Resource-Geo-Visualization

INTRODUCTION:

This project aims to provide a geo-visualization of industrial human resource data, allowing users to explore and analyze workforce distribution across different states and districts.


Data Sources & Guidelines:

The project utilizes data from various sources, including Data Sources. The Project follows Google Docs guidelines.


Prerequisites:

Python: Programming Language
pandas: Python Library for Data Visualization
numpy: Fundamental Python package for scientific computing in Python
streamlit: Python framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps
scikit-learn: Machine Learning library for the Python programming language
Natural Language Processing (NLP): A library in Python for working with human language data, including tokenization, stemming, tagging, and more.

Approach:

The project follows a fundamental outline:

Data Merging: Merge provided CSV data files to create a comprehensive DataFrame.
Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore and clean the data, addressing issues such as missing values and inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize industries into groups such as Retail, Poultry, Agriculture, and Manufacturing.
Machine Learning: Perform machine learning tasks, including training a model to predict relevant workforce features.
Geo-Visualization: Develop a dashboard app using Streamlit and Plotly to visually represent the distribution of workers across various industries with respect to different geographical regions.
